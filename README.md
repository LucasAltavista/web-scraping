Getting information on internet with selenium

The ideia of the program is to get information from internet websites where it is not possible to iterate or map the logical url adress to use spy methods on background.

In the case of latitude and longitude there are already some APIs (such as google) to do it on background. But there are sometimes where it is not possible to do such a thing. And, instead of using python pyautogui, we can use selenium to have the browser and html control and instance.

The program in python uses selenium. In this program i used mozilla browzer because of mozila's open source ideia, and for the reason, the driver geckodriver for mozila is also on this repository
