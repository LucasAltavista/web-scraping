Getting information on internet with selenium

The ideia of the program is to get information from internet websites where it is not possible to iterate or map the logical url adress to use spy methods on background.

The program in python use selenium. In this program i used mozilla browzer because of mozila's open source ideia, and for the reason, the driver geckodriver for mozila is also on this repository
